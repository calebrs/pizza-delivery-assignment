Thanks for checking out my pizza delivery assignment solution! Here's what's included and how to run it:

## Files

### pizza-delivery-notes.txt

This file includes the initial notes I took before I started coding. This includes defining the problem, looking at the examples, brainstorming data-structures, and writing an algorithm with psudo-code.
Use this to take a peak into how I came up with the solution.

### pizza-delivery-input.js

This file is a simple module that gets the input from where it's hosted. It uses the Axios dependancy to easily grab the input data.

### pizza-delivery-part-one.js

Solution to part one of the problem. This file includes the test cases I used to test the solution at the bottom of the doc. The final answer can be found on line 40

### pizza-delivery-part-two.js

Solution to part two of the problem. This file includes the test cases I used to test the solution at the bottom of the doc. The final answer can be found on line 45
